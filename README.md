## 🚀 What is Caset Network?

Caset Network is a gamified Web3 platform built around dynamic, AI-enhanced NFTs and a tiered identity system (Caset ID). Users mint Caset ID NFTs to access faucet rewards, stake for benefits, and unlock evolving utilities for their NFTs. The project plans to launch **Caset Chain**, an OP Stack–based Layer 2 blockchain focused on low-cost, high-speed AI interactions, NFT minting, and smart contract deployment.
